<h1>Project 3 - Destination Travel App!</h1>
<h4>Sprint 1</h4>
<p>The base of this extended application is to enable chatbot functionality that allows users to have all travel needs met within a few commands. We aim to successfully integrate one new API per person, and add the associated chatbot command by the end of this checkpoint.<br>
<h4>Sprint 2</h4>
<p>Building on the above, we’d like to add styling to the page to make it look more like a travel application. We’d also like to add in the second new API (per person), more tables for our persistence via a database.<br>
<h4>New API's Added</h4>
<p>Genius Music API: User should see recommend song from destination.<br>
<p>Currency-Converter5 API: used to convert currency. <br>
<p>My Memory API -  used to translate language.<br>
<p>Cometari Airport Finder - finds local airports<br>
<p>Reisewarnung API - provides user with up to date travel advice<br>
<p>Trail API: provides user with outdoor activities for selected destination.<br>
<h4>Sprint 3</h4>
<p>Finishing things up, we will spend the last two weeks fixing bugs in our app, including integration problems, database issues, styling troubles, etc. We’d also like to add a social login (Twitter), names and pictures for the active users, and rendered image and web page links -- since we have done these before, this should be simpler.<br>
