# Project 2 Checkooint 1

## Theme
    For this project, I chose a relaxation chat room. Life can be stressful, and I decided to create a room to help take people aay from their stressful lives. This is incorporated by having an open room for discussion, quotes, and "imagine" scenes being relased in the chat.


## 5 Issues
This project gave me ALOT of problems:
1.  I struggled to push to my repo. I'm not sure if the problem came from cloning a repo from a class lecture, ut I wasn't allowed to push for awhile. I encountered this same problem last semester.
2.  My entire webpage was scrolling, when it wasnt supposed to. I ended up having to decrease some fonts, in order to prevent the page from moving.
3.  I also struggled to get some of the chatbot comamands to work. These were fixed with ALOT of trial and error. (Most of the problems were basic syntax errors).
4.  Because of my repo problems, pushing to heroku could not happen. Once I could push, i was able to use add on Heroku
5.  I encountered some problemss importing files, which caused almost nothing to work. I ended up having to change file names, and for some reason that worked fine.



## Problems

Currently, the user name does not show with the message. Also the user count does not work.At one point I had a count showing, but it was the wrong number, so I decided to remove that piece of code. Also, after a user sends a message, the text they send remains in the box.


## Improvements

Hopefully moving forward in this project, I will be able to get the username and user count up and runnin. I tend to struggle with visuals, so I am loking into improving the look and feel of the application.
