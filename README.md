# Project 2 Checkooint 3

## Why these Tests:
I chose these tests to test the functions that I struggled with, while completing this project. I struggled with getting the chatbot responses to properly work, getting SocketIO working. Theses tests allowed me to check all of the functionalities of my code.


## Improvements
I would like to be able to test the rest of the SocketIO functions, and possibly try working on more integration tests. I would also like to work on making my chatbot command for imagine to work.
