<h1>Project 3 - Destination Travel Chat!</h1>
<h3>Checkpoint 1</h3>
<p>The base of this extended application is to enable chatbot functionality that allows users to have all travel needs met within a few commands. We aim to successfully integrate one new API per person, and add the associated chatbot command by the end of this checkpoint.<br>
<h5>API's Added</h5>
<p>Genius Music API: User should see recommended song from destination.<br>
<p>Currency-Converter5 API: used to convert currency. <br>
<p>Trail API: provides user with outdoor activities for selected destination.<br>
  
<h3>Checkpoint 2</h3>
<p>Building on the above, we’d like to add styling to the page to make it look more like a travel application. We’d also like to add in the second new API (per person) and more tables for our persistence via a database<br>
<h5>Latest API's Added</h5>
<p>My Memory API: provides language translation to improve communication during travel<br>
<p>Airport Finder API: User can view airport names for selected destination. <br>
<p>Travel Warnings API: provides user with travel danger rating and travel advice for selected destination.<br>
