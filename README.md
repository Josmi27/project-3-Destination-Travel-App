# Project 2 Checkooint 1

## Theme
For this project, I chose a relaxation chat room. Life can be stressful, and I decided to create a room to help take people aay from their stressful lives. This is incorporated by having an open room for discussion, quotes, and "imagine" scenes being relased in the chat.


## 4 Issues
This project gave me ALOT of problems:
1.  I again had trouble with my repo, I ended up having to switch environments in order for me to push properly.
2.  When first starting on this project, I pulled from checkpoint1 and nothing worked. I again had to switch enviroments to get everything that worked on Checkpoint1 to work again.
3. I struggled with getting the Google button to work. It worked on the lecture10 code, but when I incorporated it into my project, no matter what I did it made my entire chat disappear. I ended up having to remove it from my code.
4.  I struggled constantly pushing to heroku. After an hour of changing small pieces of code, it finally worked. 



## Problems

Currently, the user name does not show with the message.

## Improvements

I would love to get the Google button, username, and pictures to show up.
