        <font color="#e5a56f"><strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Joy Elias - Computer Science Senior at Morgan State University
                <br><em>Fun fact:</em></li>
                <br><em>Fun fact: I've traveled to Mexico 4 times.</em></li>

                <br><li>Morgan Whitaker - Computer Science Senior at Morgan State University
                <br><em>Fun fact: I am ambidextrous. </em>        
                </li>

                <br><li>Joshua Smith - Computer Science Senior at Morgan State University
                <br><em>Fun fact: I am left-handed.</em></li></strong></font>

        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHAT HAVE WE MADE? WHAT DOES IT EVEN DO?</span>
        <br><ul><font color="#e5a56f"><strong><li>We have made a real-time chat app accessible 
        from the browser. The chat app <br>features an international chatbot which enables users to do tasks like: 
        find local <br>airports to various countries, provide users with up to date travel advice, and <br>provide
        recommended songs for the selected destination</li></strong></font></ul>
        
        <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOW DID WE MAKE IT? (Technologies Included)</span>
        <br><ul><font color="blue"><strong><li> To create this chat app, we utilized AWS Cloud9 as environment to test and create <br>our code.
        We used Flask for the backend of our site and React/JS for the front-end, <br>tied in with SocketIO. To expand on the features of our application
        we pulled in <br>multiple APIs: Genius Music, Currency Converter-5, My Memory API, Cometari <br>Airport Finder, Reisewarnung API, and Trail API. These
        APIs allowed us to access <br>music, airport names, travel advisories, currency conversions, activities and more. <br>We stored our code on a 
        group repository on Github. </li></strong></font></ul>
        
        <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHY DOES IT MATTER?</span>
        <br><ul><font color="blue"><strong><li>As Computer Science students heading into industry in the coming months, it was <br>important that we
        understood all that need to go into creating a complex application. <br>When creating a project, it is important to know who and what you are
        are making <br>it for to make sure that all possible needs and wants are taken care of. Creating this <br>chat app, with a theme focused on travel,
        helped us learn how to manuever around <br>the "wants" of the customer and to put out a product that worked and would make <br>people happy. Using this
        travel theme allowed us to think about what people would <br>actually want to see in an application and what features needed to to create a great <br>app. 
        This project helped us experience a lot of what we will be experiencing as we <br>enter into industry. </li></strong></font></ul>
